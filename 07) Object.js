1) Create Object:
We can use the Object type to store related compound values together, like all the details of a car. 
For example, the fuelType of a car can be stored within a car object.
const car = {fuelType: "diesel"};

console.log(car);

2) Object with Multiple Properties:
Example:
const car = {
  model: 2011,
  fuelType: "diesel"
};
console.log(car);
