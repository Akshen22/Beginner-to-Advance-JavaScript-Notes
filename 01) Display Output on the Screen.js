2) Showing Message in console:
In JavaScript, content just doesn't appear on the screen by itself. 
We need to use "console.log()" to make it visible on a special screen called console.

Example:
a) console.log("I love ice cream");
b) console.log(20-10)

3) Console - Logging multiple values:
If you want to put multiple messages on the screen, you can put them in the same console.log(). 
Separate the different values using commas.

Example: 
a) console.log(1+8, 10+20) /* Ans) 9,30*/
b) console.log("Good morning!", "Have a good day!")
