Dive into objects, which are collections of key-value pairs used to store and manage data.

### 📊 Array
Learn how to create and manipulate arrays, a fundamental data structure for handling lists of data.

### 🔄 Array Methods 1
Discover basic array methods such as `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()`.

### ❓ Conditionals
Master `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements to control the flow of your code based on conditions.

### 🔁 Logical Operations
Use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to evaluate complex conditions.

### 🔄 Type Conversions
Learn how to convert between different data types like strings and numbers.

### 🛠️ Functions
Understand how to define and use functions to create reusable blocks of code.

### 🔄 Array Methods 2
Explore more advanced array methods including `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

### 🔄 Loops
Use loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`) to repeat actions and iterate over arrays.

### 🌐 Document Object Model (DOM)
Learn about the DOM and how to interact with HTML elements dynamically using JavaScript.

### 🔍 Selecting DOM Elements
Understand how to select and access HTML elements with methods like `getElementById()` and `querySelector()`.

### 🔧 Manipulating DOM Elements Part 1
Discover how to change and update content and attributes of DOM elements.

### 🔧 Manipulating DOM Elements Part 2
Learn advanced techniques for creating, removing, and cloning DOM elements.

### 📅 Browser Events
Handle events such as clicks and form submissions to create interactive web applications.

### 📝 Single and Multiple Line Comments
Use single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments to document your code effectively.

### 🔄 Array Methods 3
Explore additional array methods like `find()`, `some()`, and `every()`.

### 🌐 Rest and Spread
Learn how to use the rest (`...`) and spread (`...`) operators to work with arrays and functions.

### 🔒 Scope
Understand variable scope including global, local, and block scopes.

### ⏲️ Timeouts and Intervals
Use `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` to execute code after a delay or at intervals.

### 📅 Date
Work with the `Date` object to manage dates and times in JavaScript.

### 💾 LocalStorage and SessionStorage
Store and retrieve data persistently using `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.

### 📄 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
Learn how to parse and stringify JSON for data interchange.

### 🗃️ Array Destructuring
Use array destructuring to extract values from arrays into variables.

### 🏗️ Object Destructuring
Explore object destructuring to assign properties to variables in a concise manner.

### 🔗 Optional Chaining
Safely access deeply nested properties with optional chaining (`?.`).
