1) Create Array:

a) An array is used to store multiple values together.
An array is built by a pair of square brackets, with values placed inside it separated by commas.
Let us take an example of a list of fruits:
const fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"];
console.log(fruits);

b) Arrays in JavaScript are special kind of objects. Similar to an object, it can hold a mix of different data types.
Consider the following example:
const mixedArray = [1, True, "Hi", null, undefined];
console.log(mixedArray);
