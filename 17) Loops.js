1) for loop:
for (let abc = 1; abc < 6; abc++) {
  console.log(abc);
}

Steps:
Step 1: Before the loop starts, `let abc = 1` is run, setting `abc` to 1. This only happens once before the loop begins.
Step 2: The loop checks if `abc < 6`. If true, the loop runs. Since `abc` starts at 1, the condition is true, so the loop runs.
Step 3: After running the loop's code once (one iteration), `abc++` increases its value by 1.
Step 4: The loop then checks the condition again (`abc < 6`). If true, it repeats the process. If false, the loop stops.
The loop keeps running until `abc` reaches 6. Then, the condition is false, and the loop stops.
